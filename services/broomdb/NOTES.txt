We can represent a table in postgres as an object using semantics
such as the following.

Each row in a given table becomes an object.

Each column becomes a field on the object, subject to the constraints
determined by the data dictionary. 

Each column in the table's PK becomes a PK field on the object.

Each column in each table UK becomes a UK on the object.

Each incoming FK becomes a deferred query to the outgoing
table on the current PK.

Each outgoing FK becomes a deferred query to the incoming
table.

Each FK table may be used purely for linkage; in this case
we have nothing but other keys, and punt again during
object creation, but again, don't select.
